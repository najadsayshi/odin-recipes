    <h1>Mandhi</h1>

    <img src="../images/mandhi" alt="Mandhi">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Mandi is a traditional Yemeni rice dish known for its smoky flavor,
        tender meat, and fragrant spices. It is especially popular across
        the Middle East and is often served at gatherings and celebrations.
    </p>

    <p> The dish is cooked by slow-roasting meat and serving it over spiced rice,
        typically made with a blend of mild aromatics rather than heavy masalas.
        The meat is usually chicken or lamb.
    </p>

        <li>1 tbsp mandi spice mix (hawajj)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick, 3 cloves, 3 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare chicken: Rub chicken pieces with mandi spice mix, salt, and a little oil.
            Let it marinate for 20–30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken: In a pot, heat ghee and add whole spices. Add onions and garlic,
            sauté until soft. Add tomatoes and cook until mushy. Place chicken on top,
            cover, and cook on medium heat until the chicken is tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook rice: Wash and soak rice for 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the pot once cooked.
            Add rice to the same pot with the broth left behind. Add water as needed and cook rice
            until done.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast chicken: Place the cooked chicken under the oven grill or air fryer for a few minutes
            until golden and slightly smoky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optional smoke: Place a small piece of hot charcoal in a bowl, set it in the pot,
            add a drop of oil, cover immediately, and smoke for 2 minutes for authentic mandi aroma.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve: Spread rice on a plate and place roasted chicken on top. Garnish with fried onions
            or nuts if desired.
