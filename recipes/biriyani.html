    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish of Persian origin that
        is popular in South Asia, made with rice, meat 
        (such as chicken, lamb, or beef), fish, or vegetables, and various spices
    </p>

    <p> It is a flavorful and aromatic dish often made for celebratory occasions,
        though it's also a common street food. The name "biryani" comes from the
        Persian word beryā(n), meaning "fried" or "roasted".

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul class="Ingredients">
        <li>500 g chicken (bone-in pieces)</li>
        <li>350–400 g basmati rice (2–2½ cups)</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>150 g yogurt (¾ cup)</li>
        <li>3–4 cloves garlic, crushed; 1-2 inch ginger, grated</li>
        <li>3–4 green chilies (slit) — optional</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro + 1/4 cup mint leaves</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            Fry onions: Heat 2 tbsp oil/ghee in a wide pan. 
            Fry sliced onions until deep golden brown and crisp. 
            Remove and drain on paper towel. Reserve half for garnish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken: In the same pan, add a little oil if needed, 
            add whole spices (cumin, bay, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and 
            let them sizzle 20–30 seconds. Add remaining ginger-garlic,
            sauté 30 sec. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Add marinated chicken, cover and
            cook on medium heat ~10–12 minutes until chicken is mostly 
            cooked and oil separates. Stir in remaining garam masala and adjust salt. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Parboil rice: Bring a large pot of water to boil, add salt and a splash of oil. Add soaked rice
            and cook until it’s about 70% done — grains still have a slight white core (about 6–7 minutes depending
            on rice). Drain and immediately rinse with cold water/ice to stop cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layering for dum: In a heavy-bottomed pot (or the same wide pan if oven safe), spread half the partially
            cooked rice evenly. Spoon the chicken mixture over the rice. Sprinkle half the fried onions, half the chopped
            mint/cilantro and some slit green chilies. Add the remaining rice on top. Sprinkle remaining fried onions, herbs,
            saffron milk, and a drizzle (1–2 tbsp) of ghee. Optionally poke a few holes with a spoon so steam can circulate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seal & cook (dum): Cover tightly with a lid. For better seal, use dough or foil under the lid. Cook on very low heat
            for 20–25 minutes (stovetop dum). Alternatively, preheat oven to 180°C (350°F) and bake covered for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest & mix: Turn off heat and let rest for 5–10 minutes. Open, gently fluff and mix the layers so rice and chicken combine without breaking grains.
        </li>
